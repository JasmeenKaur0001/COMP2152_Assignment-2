# PortScanner inherits from NetworkTool, allowing it to reuse existing attributes and methods.
# For example, the constructor is reused using super().__init__(target).

    # Using threads improves performance significantly by parallel execution.

# Q5: New Feature Proposal
# I would add a feature to classify open ports based on security risk levels (high, medium, low).
# This would use nested if-statements to check port numbers and assign a risk category.
